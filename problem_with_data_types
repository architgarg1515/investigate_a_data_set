#Then i tried

#and got this error 
#AttributeError: Can only use .str accessor with string values!


#Then I went and checked the data types as suggested to me with 
df.dtypes

#Said vote_count was a float
#Then entered in
df.astype(int)
#When I ran df.dtypes it said vote_count was an int but then when I run 
df['vote_count'].describe()
#It says it is a float again.
